            <p class="11">When you think of graphic design, do you think of artistic advertisements? Eye-grabbing
                graphics on websites? Stunningly arranged spreads in magazines? While these examples certainly fit
                under the graphic design definition, the term encompasses a lot: posters, infographics, book covers,
                product labels, logos, business cards, signs, website layouts, mobile apps, software interfaces—the
                list goes on.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="22">
                So what is graphic design, exactly? Listing these graphic design examples is a good start, but it
                doesn’t paint the full picture. While covering the details and intricacies of the entire graphic
                design field might not be possible in one article, this high-level overview will help you better
                understand this creative career field.

            <h1>
                First, what is graphic design?
            </h1>
            <p class="dd">
                According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as “the art
                and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.” In
                other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals
                can be as simple as a business logo, or as complex as page layouts on a website.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Graphic design takes graphical and textual elements and implements them into multiple types of
                media,” says designer Alexandros Clufetos, when asked to elaborate on the graphic design definition.
                “It helps the producer connect with the consumer. It conveys the message of the project, event,
                campaign or product.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising, by
                websites to convey complicated information in a digestible way through infographics, or by
                businesses to develop an identity through branding, among other things.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Every day, we take many of the subtly artistic things around us for granted. But hidden in every
                magazine corner, exit sign or textbook lies a set of design ideas that influence our perceptions,”
                says Jacob Smith, founder of illustration studio ProductViz.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also important to remember that although many graphic design projects have commercial purposes
                like advertisements and logos, it is also used in other contexts and graphic design work is often
                created purely as a means for artistic expression.
                <br>
                <br>
            <h1>Graphic design basics</h1>
            <br>
            To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and
            principles that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create
            visually striking and impactful designs.
            <br>
            <br>
            These graphic design elements include:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <br>
                <li>Form</li>
                <br>
                <li>Line</li>
                <br>
                <li>Shape</li>
                <br>
                <li>Size</li>
                <br>
                <li>Space</li>
                <br>
                <li>Texture</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines
            that
            help a design achieve effective composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and
            stability
            for the piece of work.
            <br>
            <br>
            These graphic design principles include:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Balance</li>
                <br>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <br>
                <li>Emphasis</li>
                <br>
                <li>Movement</li>
                <br>
                <li>Proportion</li>
                <br>
                <li>Rhythm</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            You’ve heard the old saying that “rules are meant to be broken,” which can certainly ring true in this
            case.
            But a good graphic designer must first understand these principles before making the conscious decision
            to
            break them.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Types of graphic design</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            As mentioned earlier, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design is composed of many
            fields
            and specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design
            offers opportunities and options for individuals of almost any interest.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you’d asked someone 30 years ago to define graphic design, their answer would have likely been
            focused on
            print-related examples like magazines, movie posters and advertisements. Now we’re living in the digital
            age, which has given birth to several new types of graphic design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the most notable modern-day graphic design examples stem from advancements in technology. Here’s
            a
            glimpse of some of these types of graphic design:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Website design</h2> involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users. This
                    includes
                    overall
                    layout, color scheme and navigation.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h2>User experience (UX) design</h2> is focused on ensuring a website or application is easy and
                    satisfying
                    to use. These designers emphasize value, usability, adoptability and desirability.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Motion graphics design</h2>—or animation—brings visual elements to life through special
                    effects,
                    TV shows, video games and movies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Common graphic design jobs</h1>
            With technological advancements introducing new types of graphic design, there has also been an
            emergence of
            new graphic design jobs. This evolution has changed the entire landscape of careers in this field.
            <br>
            <br>
            Demand for “traditional” graphic designers who work primarily for print publishers has fallen
            substantially,
            but that doesn’t tell the whole story. Employment of graphic designers in computer systems design
            services
            is projected to grow by 24 percent through 2028, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1
            Much of
            this demand is spurred by business’ and organizations’ increased need for digital graphics and imagery
            as
            they aim to increase their digital presence.
            <br>
            <br>
            So with that said, what are some common graphic design job titles? We analyzed more than 30,000 job
            postings
            calling for a graphic design degree over the past year.2 The data helped us determine the most common
            job
            titles:
            <ul>
                <li>Graphic designer</li>
                <br>
                <li>User experience (UX) designer</li>
                <br>
                <li>Web designer</li>
                <br>
                <li>Art director</li>
                <br>
                <li>Creative director</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            As you can see, once armed with the proper knowledge and training, there are several graphic design job
            options out there. You have the ability to cater your career to your personal skills and interests.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Popular graphic design tools</h1>
            Now that you know what type of jobs and specializations are out there, it’s helpful to familiarize
            yourself
            with the graphic design tools that help get the job done. One of the most basic, and least expensive,
            tools
            designers use is a sketchbook. Graphic designers will often sketch out ideas or rough drafts on paper
            before
            turning to a computer to complete the process.
            <br>
            <br>
            That being said, computers and design software are essentials in today’s digital climate, even if you
            are
            designing for print. The type of computer you need is based on preference, but when it comes to
            software,
            Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are mainstays in the graphic design world. If
            you
            are just beginning and don’t want to commit to the high price tag Adobe products often carry, similar
            free
            open-source software such as GIMP can help you begin to master the basics.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, ideas and inspiration are what a graphic designer needs most. “You need to have a solid concept
            serving as the foundation of your design and communication,” explains Chad Birenbaum, co-founder of
            Duckpin
            Design. “This concept and idea needs to work on paper first and then the computer should be used as a
            tool
            to bring the concept to life.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Graphic designers gain inspiration from the world around them, so if you are worried you aren’t creative
            enough, go outside, bounce ideas off your peers or seek ideas from the internet. There plenty of
            inspiring
            graphic design blogs that can help get your creative juices flowing.
            <br>

            <h1> Create your future in graphic design</p>
            </h1>
            What is graphic design, exactly? As you’ve just learned, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all definition.

            are countless ways to use graphic design to solve business problems or evoke inspiration. It’s up to you
            to
